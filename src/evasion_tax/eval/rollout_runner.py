"""Reusable closed-loop rollout runner (Task 2) — pure seams + a GPU-guarded loop.

Generalises the verified step-4 episode loop (``scripts/smoke_libero_episode.py``)
into :func:`run_episode`, which optionally injects a **frozen** adversarial suffix
into the instruction each step (the RoboGCG instruction channel, one-shot at start
— not re-optimised per step). The pure seams — suffix injection, action
normalisation, window-scored ASR, benign geometry for the DM-3 re-pin — are
unit-tested off-GPU; the LIBERO/torch body of :func:`run_episode` imports its
dependencies inside the function (never at module top), so this module stays
importable on a CUDA-free host exactly like the smoke scripts.
